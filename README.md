This repository demonstrates a subtle difference between the `removeIf` and `removeAll` functions when used with predicates in Kotlin.  Both functions aim to remove elements from a mutable list, but they do so in slightly different ways. `removeIf` removes elements in-place, iterating through the collection and removing matching items, while `removeAll` might use more optimized algorithms to remove items. This difference can lead to unexpected outcomes, especially when dealing with large collections or complex predicates.
