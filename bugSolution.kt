The functions `removeIf` and `removeAll` operate similarly, but their internal implementations may cause different performance characteristics.  For most use cases, there is no significant difference in results.  However, if you're working with large datasets and performance is crucial, you may want to benchmark both to determine which performs better.  The primary difference is that `removeIf` modifies the collection directly, while `removeAll` may use more sophisticated algorithms based on the input,potentially leading to different behaviors. For clarification, always refer to Kotlin's official documentation.
